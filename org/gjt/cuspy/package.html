org.gjt.cuspy (top level) is not so much a single package as a home for useful
standalone classes too small to get packages of their own:<BR><DL>
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.Rethrown}</DT>
<DD>Throw a checked exception, unchecked exception, or
error, without losing information contained in an earlier exception.<BR>
(similar: {@link org.gjt.jem.utils.exceptions.WrapperedException})<BR></DD>
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.Interned}</DT>
<DD>Like String.intern() but for any object, so you can
use <CODE>==</CODE> instead of <CODE>equals()</CODE>.<BR></DD>
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.ByteString}</DT>
<DD>For reliable general file processing or
line/character based net protocols where non-Unicode platforms are
involved.<BR></DD>
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.JarX}</DT>
<DD>Self-extracting jars that also safely convert extracted
text files to the receiver's encoding and newline conventions.<BR></DD></DL>
If there's a common theme, it's to help with writing reliable, secure code.
<P>
These classes (with any inner classes they include) may be treated as units
of distribution; in fact, each one (will have)
a jar file available for download (as soon as I can make that work on GJT).
If you develop for the Java 1.2 runtime environment, you can treat these jars
as
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/extensions/">
extensions</A>: they can be placed in the <CODE>jre/lib/ext</CODE>
directory of the runtime system if heavily used, and any that are not so
installed can be automatically downloaded with your app.
<P>
Here are some more notes on the classes:
<DL><DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.Rethrown}</DT>
<DD>API requirements sometimes call for catching an
exception and throwing one of a different type.
With this class you can do that and not lose
invaluable debugging information, and the level of detail shown can be changed
without access to the source or recompiling, so mysterious problems can be
tracked down in the field.
Java 1.1 or 1.2.
</DD>
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.Interned}</DT>
<DD>
Requires Java 1.2 because it uses WeakReferences to allow intern map space to
be reclaimed when the objects are unreachable (like a WeakHashMap, but this
is concerned with when the objects themselves are released, where WeakHashMap
is concerned with the keys).
</DD>
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.ByteString}</DT>
<DD>If you do any programming involving line/character-based network protocols,
or general-purpose file processing and your OS isn't something like Plan9 that's
Unicode from the ground up, <EM>please</EM> at least read the rationale
in this class API doc, and avoid writing unreliable, unsafe code!
Depending on your application, you may find this class convenient.
Needs Java 1.2 because it uses Interned.
<DT>{@link org.gjt.cuspy.JarX}</DT>
<DD>Works with Java 1.1 and later.</DD>
